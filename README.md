## Book Tracker A4

This website is a book tracker that lets you keep track of books you've read, are reading, or are going to read. Since assignment 3, the project has been split into a frontend (React+Vite) and a backend (Express). The website is now split into components like the book table and the add a book form, and utilizes useState and component props to pass, store, and update information. 

Using React did allow me to cut out large chunks of code - especially when it came to updating the table since the table component will now dynamically generate the rows instead of having to manipulate the HTML. In general, using components to dynamically update the website was much less complicated than using HTML/CSS/JS. However, splitting the backend and frontend up into different frameworks was not easy to set up and was definitely the most frustrating part.
